# 2022 Shopify Backend Challenge - Inventory Tracking App


In order to track inventory items, this application was created using Node.js, Express and MongoDb.

Additionally, a simple front-end developed using PUG and CSS was included to make interaction with the backend easier.

## Requirements
To run this application you need to have Node and MongoDB installed.

## Installation

Use NPM in your prompt to run the following command inside cloned BackendChallenge folder.

```bash
npm install
```

With this NPM is going to install all dependecies necessary to run this project.

## Usage
Start your server by running
```bash
node index.js
```
Or:
```bash
npm run dev
```
In the console you will have the address your tracking app is running and the result from tests:

```bash
input: [object Object] expect: true Test result:Passed
input: [object Object] expect: false Test result:Passed
input: [object Object] expect: false Test result:Passed
input: [object Object] expect: false Test result:Passed
input: [object Object] expect: false Test result:Passed
input: [object Object] expect: false Test result:Passed
Listening on http://localhost:8888
```
In this case, I can navigate to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to interact with the Inventory Tracking App using your browser.
